    <!-- PROBLEM -->

    <section class="problem">

        <h2>You're Talented — But You're Doing Everything Alone.</h2>



        <p>

            Writing. Recording. Mixing. Editing. Marketing. Posting content.  

            Keeping up with algorithms. Staying consistent.  

        </p>



        <p>

            The industry changed. Artists aren't artists anymore — they're full production teams.

        </p>



        <p class="bold">

            And no independent artist can do all that sustainably without burning out.

        </p>

    <!-- SOCIAL PROOF -->

    <section class="social-proof">

        <h2>Independent Artists Want This.</h2>



        <p>Here's what artists say after seeing the early demo:</p>



        <blockquote>"Bro… this would cut my workflow from days to hours."</blockquote>

        <blockquote>"I could finally release consistently. This is the future."</blockquote>



        <p class="small">

            The demand is clear: artists want speed, consistency, and a system that handles the hard parts.
